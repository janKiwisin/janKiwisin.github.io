                <h1>A message from yours truly:</h1>
                <p>Hello, I am Kiwisin. Some of you may know me better by other names, such as Kwaznini, Kiw "The Larg" Isin, or Kiwisin (stress on the second 'i'). I am a big fan of a multitude of topics, such as language learning, making music (click the "Music" tab up top!!!), and most recently: webpage design! Back in high school, I got a certification in webpage design, which is pretty cool. However, I have realized that a sheet of paper does not magically help me retain knowledge unless I actually practice regularly.</p>
                <p>With all that being said, please enjoy your stay on my website!!!</p>
